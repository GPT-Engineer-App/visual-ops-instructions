# visual-ops-instructions

Project Description:

Develop a Python-based web app to visualize system operation instructions from a JSON file onto an HMI picture. Users can upload both files.

Key Features:

File Upload: Allow users to upload JSON file and HMI picture.
JSON Parsing: Extract operation instructions including equipment modules, controllers, transitions, prompts, and messages.
Name Extraction: Extract valve and pump names, equipment modules, controllers, transitions, prompts, and messages from JSON and HMI picture.
Image Processing: Process HMI picture to overlay extracted information onto images.
Sequence Generation: Generate image sequence representing each operation step.
Visualization: Display images with operation instructions. Place controllers, transitions, prompts, and messages outside images.
User Interaction: Implement user-friendly features like step navigation.
Additional Considerations:

Ensure robustness against various JSON structures and HMI picture qualities.
